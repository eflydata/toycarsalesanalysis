## How to Use

1. **Create the database**

   ```sql
   SOURCE db_setup.sql;
   ```

2. **Run analysis queries**

   ```sql
   SOURCE analysis.sql;
   ```

3. Used SQL client MySQL Workbench 8.0

## Key Concepts Used

* Aggregations (`SUM`, `COUNT`)
* Window functions (`RANK`, `NTILE`)
* Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
* Joins (INNER, LEFT)
* Data grouping and ranking

## Future Improvements

* Add sample dataset for testing
* Create dashboards (e.g., Tableau, Power BI)
* Optimize queries for large-scale datasets
